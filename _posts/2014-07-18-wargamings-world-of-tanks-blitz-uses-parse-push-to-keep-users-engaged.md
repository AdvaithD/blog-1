Wargaming takes the world by storm once more with the release of <a href="http://wotblitz.com/" target="_blank">World of Tanks Blitz</a> onto iOS.  Wildly popular on desktop, World of Tanks has attracted more than 85 million players from all corners of the globe.  Now, Wargaming has put the franchise directly into the hands of its players, running on iPad 2 and up or iPhone 4S and up.  Featuring over 90 tanks from Russia, Germany, and the U.S., players can challenge each other in synchronous 7-on-7 matches.

Since its release, gamers have been spending an average of 70 minutes in the game. With player engagement and long-term retention representing a core challenge, Andrey Ryabovol, Director of Global Operations at World of Tanks, turned to Parse to power push notifications as part of their strategy.

Wargaming sought to develop its mobile version of World of Tanks Blitz from the ground up.  Rather than making a port of the PC game, the team uniquely tailored the controls and experience towards use on a smartphone or tablet.  However, building their own notification solution would have taken significant resources and time. By leveraging <a href="https://parse.com/products/push" target="_blank">Parse Push</a>, Wargaming was able to focus on product development and the messaging behind keeping players informed and active in the game. High quality, targeted push notifications are crucial to keeping players engaged, especially throughout World of Tanks Blitz's 10 tiers of gameplay.  Parse Push will also be used to announce the sale of exclusive in-game items, such as premium, high-end tanks.  As Andrey explains:

> Parse Push is the ideal solution for us because it is easy to adapt to our business needs.  We have a lot of data, putting a lot of pressure on the system, so Parse was the perfect solution for data management. We consider our cooperation with Parse and Facebook as a long-term strategic partnership.

World of Tanks Blitz is available for iOS <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/world-of-tanks-blitz/id859204347?mt=8" target="_blank">on the App Store</a>.  See you on the battlefield!
